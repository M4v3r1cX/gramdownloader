# Why are you doing this?
Every single instagram downloader app is bloated as hell and has ads. I wanted to make a FOSS app that would just download stuff without much hassle and without any Google libraries.

# Usage
- Install app
- Click on the share/send button of the video post you want
- On the bottom row where you see all the apps, search for Dash Downloader
- When the link appears in the url bar, click download
- profit

# Requirements
* Android 5 onwards

# Planned Features
- Add way to download instagram pics

# Wtf is up with that name.
I made this app like in an hour, believe me I didn't give any thoughts to the name.

# License
All MIT license and stuff. I doubt anyone will have the exact specific case use I had but if you're crazy enough to use this piece of crap code, go wild. It's yours. I don't want it, that's why I'm sharing it.
